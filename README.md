# AsciiChess
Console based chess made with C++.
To start off, if you don't want to get too detailed with the project i'd recommend to go and download just the source code, create a new project in your IDE and copy paste the code to your project, notice that there are multiple code files, not one.
if you just want to play the game i would recommend to try and download the EXE file, if it doesn't run, just do what i said earlier and you will find an EXE file in the DEBUG folder of your project.
